		<b><h1>Personal Profile</h1></b>
		A confident communicator across all levels, I am a process driven individual with a natural ability to think outside the box. 
		In addition to my genuine interest and enquiring mind especially when it comes to things of a technological nature; my knowledge of 
		the global economy and commercial awareness often enables me to view problems from unconventional angles.
		This together with my ability to work well within teams, my willingness to always seek other duties, and my warm and bubbly nature allows me to 
		build relationships naturally and with relative ease.
